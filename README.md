## THEORY:
```
>>Ultrasonic Module HC-SR04 works on the principle of SONAR and RADAR system. It can be used to determine the distance of an object in the range of 2 cm – 400 cm.
>>The module has only 4 pins,
1.VCC
2.GND
3.Trig
4.Echo
>>When a pulse of 10µsec or more is given to the Trig pin, 8 pulses of 40 kHz are generated. After this, the Echo pin is made high by the control circuit in the module. Echo pin remains high till it gets echo signal of the transmitted pulses back.
>>The time for which the echo pin remains high, i.e. the width of the Echo pin gives the time taken for generated ultrasonic sound to travel to the object and back.
>>Using this time and the speed of sound in air, we can find the distance of the object using a simple formula for distance using speed and time.
For more information about ultrasonic module HC-SR04 and how to use it, refer the topic Ultrasonic Module HC-SR04 in the sensors and modules section.

Working of HC-SR04
The HC-SR04 emits ultrasonic waves at 40,000 Hz. In order to make it emit waves, we need to give a 10 microseconds HIGH pulse at the Trigger pin. The module responds by emitting a sonic burst of 8 pulses. This 8-pulse pattern helps differentiate the pulses emitted by the module from the ambient noise. As soon as the pulses are transmitted, the ECHO pin goes HIGH, and stays HIGH till all the reflected pulses are received. The module times out after 38ms, if all the reflected pulses are not received in this duration.

The following timing diagram explains the behavior of the module −

The time for which the Echo pin remains HIGH can help determine the distance of the sensor from the reflecting surface. The speed of sound in air is 340 m/s, or 0.034 cm/ microsecond. If the ECHO pin stays HIGH for, say 100 microseconds, then the distance travelled by the waves is: 100*0.034 = 3.4cm. Therefore, the distance from the surface is 3.4/2 = 1.7 cm (since the waves reflect back from the surface and cover the same distance again)

Thus the distance of the obstacle is measured using ultrasonic sensor and display the value in LCD and serial monitor using Arduino UNO controller.
